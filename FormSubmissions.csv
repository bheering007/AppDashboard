I personally came here 4 hours away from home and I was having a difficult time getting adjusted to being somewhere I didn‚Äôt know anything about nor did I know anyone here, so it was not easy being here initially. Thankfully my new maroon camp leaders provided tons of support and encouraged me to get out and meet everyone. I just hope I will be able to get that experience of helping others transition and just have a lot of fun while also learning cool things about Mississippi state.","I plan to support and serve fellow staff members and campers by making sure everyone is included, having a great time, and is doing okay personally. I feel that these are very big issues when it comes to group events that people don‚Äôt know anyone at. However, I will make sure I help everyone get involved and still stay safe in the meantime.","I hope to grow through this experience by challenging myself to become a better leader, I‚Äôve had past experiences leading but there is always room to improve. I also think this opportunity could help me get more involved on campus and meet new people with the same interest.",When thinking of an important quality of a leader I believe that being able to overcome and handle obstacles efficiently that are presented to said person would be one of the top qualities.,Yes,Yes,yes,Yes,Yes,yes,Photography,,Social Media,,Yes,,,

Throughout my time at state, going to camp both as a camper and a counselor has created so many memories for me and brought so many amazing friendships into my life. I think New Maroon Camp is a great way for freshman to branch out and start finding their home here and I'd love nothing more than to continue helping incoming freshman find their place here.","New Maroon Camp can be a very long and hard week for some, getting up early in the morning and staying up late each night can be challenging after a couple days. I hope to do my best to create good friendships especially within our family group and make sure I am always there and willing to talk whenever someone may need to. A huge thing that helped me during camp was our prayer meetings in the morning. I hope to be involved with that again because starting my day off with prayer surrounded by other staffers not only helped me make new friends I had never met during camp, but also brought me peace for the day to come.",This year I hope to branch out as much as possible to meet the entire staff. My biggest regret from this past year was all the people I never had the chance to meet. I hope to do my best to continue to meet people throughout the year and also branch out to the first years as much as possible. I was blessed with an incredible family group last year where all of the second and third years immediately welcomed us in and made us feel like equals. I hope to reach out to all of the first years as much as I can to make them comfortable on staff and at camp.,I think an important quality of a leader is the willingness to step up. Being able to take charge when needed but also being a companion and friend. I think one of the biggest things at camp is leading by example because the campers really to pay attention to how we act and what we do and you can see that reflected towards the end of camp. Seeing campers step up and start chants or ask to help out with things tells us we are doing our job right.,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,,,,,YAYYYY,,,

However, when I got there I had so much fun and I don‚Äôt regret signing up for it and I never will. My counselors were pretty chill, fun, and energetic and honestly the whole vibe was amazing. It was crazy to see that many people the first day but it was super fun and the morning loves and everything. I met so many people and I also made some friends to which I am still friends with and even formed a friend group that got built upon afterwards. Also shoutout to my counselor Alexis I was actually very quiet for most part and stuff but then I got more comfortable with everyone eventually. Also the camp pushed me out of my comfort zone in a good way although that confort zone was only there cause I was scared if that makes any sense. Anyways I don‚Äôt regret going to new maroon camp, I had the best possible experience ever, and I want to be able to be a part of it so that others can have a similar amazing experience like mine.","I plan to be there for everyone, support my staff members and be like a family, and include every camper from the loudest one to the quietest one because it really makes a difference. I want to form a relationship with my fellow staff members and I also want to form a relationship with my campers; I just want to be there for them whenever they need help.","I hope to become someone better an I guess also Simon people can look up to in some way cause at least when I went to new maroon camp even though my counselors and all the staff are basically my age, just knowing that they have that extra experience and how they act served as an inspiration or someone I could look up to in certain ways. I also hope to further open up cause  before camp I was scared a bit shy and closed off but I opened up quiete quickly and I want to open up wayyy more and just be there able to chat. Also just becoming a better person overall and like I‚Äôm not sure what to say yet because ven though I know what is to come, I haven‚Äôt experienced it but I have a feeling I will personally grow and enjoy this experience.","The ability to include everyone no matter how different or similar they are to you. I feel like this is a very, very important equality and I‚Äôve seen it too. Everyone who I‚Äôve looked up to as a leader or that I know would be a great leader is always willing to talk to everyone and form those relationships. They don‚Äôt put others down and in fact bring them up and cheer them on. They are happy for other‚Äôs achievements not matter how small or if they didn‚Äôt achieve it themselves. Being able to for a relationship with those you work with or see them very day is an important quality of a leader.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,,,,,Yes,,,

When I came to new maroon camp I was able to see the positive effects from a campers point of view which makes me want to continue to be a counselor in college.,"To support my fellow staff members I will encourage and help motivate everyone throughout the days, in hopes to bring positive energy and brighten peoples days. I would do the same to my campers, knowing that they are in a new environment and I have been in their shoes not too long ago I will be sure they will be comfortable and have a familiar face so as they get into the motions of navigating college life they know that they are not alone.","I hope that new maroon camp can open doors for me to meet new people and make life long friends, while help strengthen my leadership skills.","I think the most important quality of a leader is equity. In my opinion, a true good leader is one that makes everyone feel seen and heard without silencing any voices. For a leader to show that the most quiet person in the room matters is so important, because thats when people will start respecting you and honoring your leadership.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,,,Social Media,,Yes,,,

I thought about backing out the closer it came and even tried to back out of it. I attended all but two events and had the time of my life. I'm thankful to both my counselors Tori and Jesus for welcoming me and my fellow campers with such warm attitudes and bright smiles. As camp went on, I found myself enjoying it more and more. My only regret from it was not putting myself out there more. I've made some great friends already throughout and would love to see it from the counselors side. I would love to be someone who is a guide to others. Thanks to my counselors, there is a lot of things I'm looking forward to in my freshman year.","I hope to make great connections with everyone so that things can run smoothly! If I serve as a counselor, I would love to be able to share my experience and answer any questions they have about the upcoming months that they are going to go through. I feel that if I do this, I will be able to help other open up and break out of their shell just like it has helped me. If I were to serve as a buddy staff, it would be great to work one-on-one with someone. Sometimes to become adjusted to a completely new place, all you need is just one person to guide you. If I were to serve as a p-staffer, I think it'll be great for me to work behind the scenes and get a feel of how New Maroon Camp works.","My current life motto is to live each day to the fullest. Through this experience, I hope to grow as a person and as a member of the community. I'm technically classified as an ambivert though I'm more introverted. I've already grown a lot since camp and I truly hope to grow further within the next few months. It'll be a great opportunity to make connections and to grow as a leader.","There are numerous qualities that contribute to being a leader. The few that I think are the most important are: kindness, confidence, taking initiative, working well with others, and vulnerability. When leading with kindness, you are opening the community to a brighter side. Those around you will feel it and try to strive to be kind as well. When leading with confidence, you open the community to strength. Those around you will feel like you know what you're doing and will strive to live more fulfillingly. Being able to take initiative as a leader is closely tied to confidence. You take the first step in something, and others will follow. Being able to work well with others is quite important because if you cannot do that, how will you expect to lead? Lastly, vulnerability. I believe vulnerability means openly sharing your thoughts and feelings, and being honest about your limitations or uncertainties. By accepting and listening to others' criticisms, thoughts, and feelings, you invite open communication and show that you value and trust your team. This approach makes others more willing to share with you and helps you grow as a leader.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Photography,,Social Media,,Yes,,,

I met a lot of people and still talk and hang out with one of them. I loved my counselors and just think it would be a really fun way to get involved at MSU. I also think being from Starkville would help me help campers better and help tell them my background knowledge of growing up in Starkville and on campus. I really feel like camp helped me get out of my comfort zone as well.,"I plan to be positive and have fun with my fellow staff members. I also plan to help incoming freshman adapt to state and use my knowledge as a freshman and someone who grew up on state to help calm their nerves. I plan to make sure everyone has fun and be a reliable source to campers even after camp. I will use my knowledge as someone who did not participate in anything in high school since I was so shy, to help campers branch out and be themselves during and after camp.","I hope that I can gain experience in interacting with people and be a ""guide"" to them. I want to be able to grow from this by getting more out of my comfort zone since I was not involved in high school. I feel like this would be a very fun way to see how camp is from a counselor's side. This would help me in the future by being less scared to be myself and teaching others to do the same.","I think an important quality of a leader is communication. Being able to communicate with your peers is very important to making sure everyone's voices are heard. Communication and understanding go hand in hand with each other and would be very important as a counselor at New Maroon Camp. Making sure you listen to everyone and help each other grow is very powerful for the incoming freshman. They already feel smaller and lost compared to everyone, so making sure they are seen is important.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,,,,,Yes,,,

By being a member just about a month ago, I can truly say it has helped me find my place here on campus, and by beginning my connections to do what I want to do and to feel welcomed as well. If I can be involved in NMC in any way, I'd be able to bring that experience to incoming freshmen and help them feel welcomed and appreciated here as well!","I plan to support and serve fellow staff members and campers here at NMC by being a big communicator and a team player. A big value held by NMC is the idea of community and by making every single person feel welcomed. Even though we're all different and from different places, we're able to come together and just be something else for a change. I think I would be good to hold this ideal high because I am a good communicator and especially a big team player.","I hope to personally grow through this experience by making those lifelong connections with both campers and staff. I witnessed this firsthand with my counselors (shoutout John and Kate) because they were great about reaching out and waving to me on campus and making me feel like camp never really ended. I hope to employ that if I'm given the chance to be on NMC, and to be not only a mentor and leader for these campers, but to truly be there for them if they need me. Same thing goes for the fellow counselors and being able to be a mini family with them just as I saw with each family group this year.","I believe the most important quality of a leader is that of being passionate. Not only being passionate about what you're doing but being passionate about the people you have surrounding you. A passionate leader is able to show their love for whatever organization, group, or pack that they are leading, and I truly believe that each and every time a passionate leader will perform better than one that is not. They are able to bring a hype and positive attitude to everything and will make others around them always want to do the same.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,,,,,Yes,,,

If we are given instructions as a staffer, it is our job to follow them and respect the decisions of those above us.

As a camper, I had no clue what to expect when I signed up for camp. I have never felt as loved and welcomed as I did during camp. My transition from a small town to a university was so easy because of camp. I did not know how much Starkville and MSU would mean to me by the end of my freshman year. The majority of my friendships are from camp, and my counselor is still one of my best friends. My love for NMC and this university only grew when I had the opportunity to be on staff the past two years. The community that I have found through this organization is unlike no other. Every person loves so well and is extremely passionate about Mississippi State. I want to provide this same experience to incoming freshman and transfers. I want to show them why we love this place so much and why they should too. I love seeing incoming students thrive and fall in love with campus, and I would love to have the opportunity to make them feel as loved and welcomed as I still do, every single day.","I plan to support and serve my fellow staff members by first being present. The bonds formed within each family group are incredibly special, and I believe that simply showing up as a true friend is one of the best ways I can support my team. I will also serve by offering a helping hand whenever it‚Äôs needed‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs providing physical assistance, lending emotional encouragement, or being intentional in my conversations to make sure every staffer feels valued and supported. As for campers, I want to be the person I needed during my freshman year. I plan to cheer them on, celebrate their accomplishments, and build genuine relationships that last beyond NMC. I will serve them by creating a safe and welcoming space where they feel comfortable asking questions, and navigating their freshman year. I want to be intentional with every conversation I have with every individual within this organization-whether that is staff or campers. Most importantly, I want to help facilitate an environment where they can experience how much we love this campus and, in turn, discover their own reasons to love it too.","I want to personally grow this experience in multiple ways. During the past two years, I was able to see both sides of camp and broaden my perspective of NMC. Camp truly helped me to learn about about myself and grow as a person. This year, I want to personally grow and learn more about my ""why"" in college. I truly believe that I am called to serve others in life, and I want to grow spiritually. I have learned that in order to grow, you have to know your ""why"". I was unsure of mine until last year. One of my biggest whys in college is New Maroon Camp. It truly altered my college experience and I hope to grow and learn more about who I am through camp.","An important quality of a leader is a leader who is authentically themselves.  When someone leads with honesty and genuineness, it creates trust and makes others feel comfortable being themselves too. Authentic leaders don‚Äôt just try to fit in or fake anything-they connect with people on a real level, listen with empathy, and lead by example in a way that feels genuine.

As an incoming freshman, I was scared of even the thought of a big university. However, when some of my friends informed me about NMC, it pretty much sealed the deal with MSU. A major worry of mine for college was making friends and fitting in. However, on day one of NMC, I met one of my best friends here at Mississippi State! In addition, my camp counselors were such amazing people, and they made me feel important. I am so blessed to have the connections and family NMC has provided me thus far, and I would love to help future campers feel as at home as much as I did!","There are many ways I plan to support fellow staff members and campers as a member of the NMC family.A major factor of NMC is that we do a LOT of walking. I found it helpful to play games, have fun conversations, and even sing along to music while navigating the campus with other campers. Another major factor of NMC is creating an environment to help people feel seen. I loved having pod discussions with my counselors because they always knew how to get a great conversation going. I plan to make every camper feel comfortable speaking and engaging in whatever activity we are taking part in. As for fellow staff members, check-ups and debriefs are on the top of my list. In my opinion, if the people who are giving their all to create a great environment are not having an awesome time their self, there is no way they can enjoy NMC. GroupMes will most definitely be made!","At New Maroon Camp 2025, I really came out of my shell. It seemed as if NMC pushed my social anxieties away with every activity. I have always been a very introverted, very to-myself person, but with everything we did, I saw parts of myself that I had never seen before. I was taking risks, speaking to people I did not know, and I even danced on a stage with my Ptolemy family! I would love to see these aspects of myself come out more often than not, and grow more into the type of person I saw this summer.","There are so many important qualities of a leader, but there is one thing that every leader should be able to do: sympathize. One can never really lead until they know who they are leading. To sympathize is to understand another‚Äôs situation. If a leader solely performs based on accomplishing something for the team, say winning New Maroon Camp, there will never be appreciation for the individual.

Like many others, I came to Maroon Camp hoping to break out of my social shell and make friends to enter college with. When camp began, I quickly discovered that this wasn‚Äôt necessarily the only reason for attending; New Maroon Camp made MSU feel small. Each student in attendance interacted with the next. The counselors had a way of making you feel like a friend, despite never having met them before. The daily family competitions created a sense of closeness with your family members that meant more than wearing matching colors. In post-camp reflection, so many of my peers shared their stories: like myself, many came in shy and nervous, not expecting to change that through camp. We ended camp with friends and experiences that we would never have expected. We finished with a family and a home to enter. I want to pass that experience down to the new generation of MSU freshmen. I would love to be a part of why someone is thankful they chose Mississippi State.","I plan to serve New Maroon Camp by being a staff member whom other staff and campers can count on. While NMC is meant to be fun for all, I understand that there are responsibilities that must be taken care of for the fun to happen. Behind the scenes, I know that I can be a staff member who is easy to work with and is capable of being a leader while also being able to take a step back to put others‚Äô interests before my own. On a more personal level, I know that some campers may need a little more help getting out of their shell and being willing to get the full NMC experience. I am more than willing to be someone that any camper can comfortably talk to about any issue they may be having at camp. No true hierarchy exists between staff and campers, and I want future campers to know I am their friend, not their boss.","I hope to gain a new perspective on the true meaning of being a leader and invaluable teamwork skills. Being on the New Maroon Camp staff would allow me to serve campers either behind the scenes or personally. I would love to experience the responsibility of taking the initiative to make decisions and direct people/events most efficiently, and working with others to create events, share ideas, and grow as a team. These skills can be applied beyond camp, and I believe New Maroon Camp can be a great place to start learning them.","Being adaptable is a strong quality of a good leader in any scenario. Being able to jump out of your comfort zone and be considerate of the ideas and values of others is invaluable. A leader does not stand alone, but rather surrounded by a team. The leader needs to act as a member of a body rather than a sole operator. To supplement this, a leader should also be confident enough to take charge as needed. If they are not able to step up to the plate and take the lead to reach a goal, said goal will be harder to accomplish. Combining these attributes, along with a few others, should allow one to be deemed a valuable leader and member of a team.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,,,,,Yes,,,

I met some amazing friends who were in my Pod and we are all living in the same dorm so it is really fun to see them all the time. During New Maroon Camp I was very involved in every activity, I wanted to make the most of my experience and I most certainly did. It really brought me out of my shell and I was able to connect and interact with people who I wouldn't normally.

As for campers I would love to support them in the same way I was supported as a camper. I would want to be there for them in their scary transition from high school to college.

Confidence is one thing that is beneficial in most things you do in life, but especially as a leader. When being a leader you must be confident in the words you say, decisions you make, and everything in between that. Joy is another quality that I think is very important. If you have joy in everything you do then the environment you create will be positive, welcoming, and so fun. If you have a positive attitude then the vibes in the room will be positive. It's hard to be upset, sad, when everything and everyone around you is being so joyful and positive. Then there's understanding, these freshman are new and scared. You have to be understanding of their situation and all of the new emotions they may be feeling. Finally there is authenticity, which I think goes hand in hand with confidence. Being your authentic self allows for other people to feel that they can do it too. If you are putting on this facade 9/10 people will notice that and not feel as comfortable. Being 100% you is the best thing to do as a leader.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,,,Social Media,,Yes,,,

The one thing that makes NMC so special to me and many others is the idea of community. I believe I can truly contribute to that shared value due to my collaborative skills, emphasis on communication, and how I'm unafraid to be myself. I feel like if I'm given the chance to be on NMC as a part of staff, I can truly strive to leave it better than I found it. My counselors too (shoutout John and Kate) were really good about reaching out to me and keeping in touch after camp as well. I think it would be so fun to maybe meet up with my campers for a dinner one night, or even something as simple as just asking how their classes have been.","I hope to personally grow through NMC by creating long-lasting connections with both staff and campers. With NMC being a big way future students are welcomed home onto campus, I want to be a part of this organization that makes them feel like this is their home away from home. If I can do that, I can personally grow by becoming a sort of ""mentor"" for these incoming students and be both a guide and a friend. Additionally, by being a Collegian this year, I was able to see just how much love the counselors gave towards each other and the P-staffers, so I think it would be so fun to be able to make those lifelong friends.","I would say passion. I feel like passion can be used in a lot of contexts, but I feel as though passion is one of the most important things a leader could possess. Leaders who possess that passion for what they care about will never fail to show others both their drive and love for the subject and their followers. Leaders that are able to house these qualities are the best of leaders and will pass that love down to those that follow them each and every time. It gets them more hyped, prouder of what they're doing, and just overall happier to be there.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,,,,,Yes,,,

If I become a program staffer and have to help setup the events going on, I would want to setup the most fun activities possible for campers and counselors that they remember for years to come. If I became a buddy staffer for a camper, I would want to do nothing other than show my camper how great MSU is and how they can have a great time during NMC and after.

Since I didn't know anyone, I knew that NMC was something that I wanted to do just to meet new people, so I immediately applied for it. The First day of NMC, I was very shy and standoffish, but my counselors realized and made me feel very comfortable around them. They allowed me to open up and meet my fellow collegians, who were such amazing people. Their encouragement and welcoming spirit allowed me to feel at home, and as camp continued, I met even more people who helped my transition smoothly. NMC was such a positive experience for me; I loved it, and I would recommend it to all upcoming freshmen. I know that in the next group of freshmen, there will be some who will face the same challenges I once did, of now knowing anyone and feeling singled out. By being a part of NMC, I want to give back by guiding new students, helping them feel at home, and making sure they all receive a welcoming environment just as I did.","I plan to support and serve fellow staff members and campers by bringing positive energy and encouragement, helping to create an environment where everyone can feel motivated in everything they do. I want to be someone who can step in when leadership is needed, while also offering support and guidance to make sure we are all working together to make sure the camp is running smoothly. During camp, I plan to serve the campers by being approachable and uplifting them in every aspect, allowing them to feel excited about coming to camp. Guiding them through this change, making sure that they have everything ready for the upcoming school year, and encouraging them to step outside of their comfort zone. Combining leadership, positivity, and willingly wanting to give help whenever I possibly can, I hope to make a positive and fun experience for staff and campers that is meaningful to all.","Through this experience, I hope to grow in a social aspect. Getting further out of my comfort zone, allowing people to fully see my personality, being able to communicate with any person that I come across, and making sure that I can be the most positive version of myself are just a few things that I expect to grow through socially. Additionally, I hope to grow through my leadership skills by furthering my communication skills, critical thinking, and conflict resolution, all aspects that a leader qualifies for, are ways that I hope to grow in. Lastly, I hope to become the best version of myself, where I can confidently support myself and others, bring a positive light to those around me, and continue to challenge myself with things that I may not be comfortable with.","An important quality of a leader is adaptability.

I know that camp can be a fun but also stressful time, so I want to be someone who keeps morale high, checks in on people, and reminds them that their efforts matter. For campers, I plan to show up with compassion and patience, because I know the transition into college can feel overwhelming. I want to be the person they can lean on, whether that‚Äôs through listening, giving advice, or simply making them feel included. For staff, I aim to be a teammate who steps up when help is needed, celebrates others‚Äô successes, and ensures that no one feels like they‚Äôre carrying the weight alone.

As a counselor, you work with students from all different backgrounds and personalities have the really outgoing ones, but you also have the quiet ones who might not feel as comfortable right away. I truly believe that being inclusive goes a long way in making every camper feel like they belong. This past year, I had a camper who was very quiet and kept to himself. By the end of camp, he was on stage dancing during the Lip Sync Battle, and afterward he came up to me and thanked me for making him feel seen. He told me that he usually keeps to himself and never thought he could make friends, but New Maroon Camp helped him realize that wasn‚Äôt true.

New Maroon Camp accepted me as a friend as a freshman and again as a sophomore when I applied, even though I was not the typical first year applicant. Through New Maroon Camp, I have found a place that I can give back to the most vulnerable, our freshman, who are stepping into a new experience. While I have given so much, I received so much last year serving on staff last year, and I want to continue to pour into others, as well as be poured into.","My favorite facet that I was able to serve in during NMC last year was acting as Bob Ross for Morning Moves. I loved being able to serve as a safe space for the freshman, often offering a way to start our morning with a piece of calm before the busy days ahead. I want to serve in that capacity: to serve as a grounding individual for staff members and campers. I don't want to just offer a piece of peace with a curly wig on my head. I want to be able to be a trustworthy staffer that campers and staff can come to when they're feeling stressed. Each person has had ""that"" moment during camp. You feel like everything has become way too much. I want to be a friend who acknowledges these moments, meets each person where they are at, and offer some help!","I hope to personally grow in patience, as well as ability to go with the flow. Camp will not go perfectly. As a P-Staffer, events will go off schedule. Events will not go exactly how they were planned during meetings. Being able to let go of that box that I have for an event is a way that I want to grow as both a professional and a person. P-Staff also offers me an opportunity to continue to grow my collaborative skills. Last year, I learned more about delegation, as well as how to take a step back whenever I feel like I am doing more than what I probably should do. I love to go above and beyond, but it is so important for each member of a committee to put their mark on an event! Finally, I want to continue to grow in being able to stand my ground. Even when campers become upset when playing a game, I want to continue to say ""No,"" and not just give in because I am being pressured.","I think the most important quality of a leader is inclusivity. The best leaders are not the ones who stand in front of a group and talk at someone; they sit alongside their peers and listen. Including all individuals in the conversation allows for growth. This is an idea I try to apply in all facets of my leadership, whether I am serving as SA Secretary, in an internship, or even just sitting and eating lunch with my best friends. Including all voices has deepened my understanding of those around me, as well as allowed me to change my mind on things when I am wrong.",Yes!!,Yes!!,Yes!!,Yes!!!,Yes!!,Yes!!,Photography,,Social Media,,Sounds perfect :),,,

I would make sure to communicate ideas and strategies to my team and support them when needed.,"From this experience, I hope to not only learn from my team but from campers as well. I have always enjoyed meeting people from different cities and states that could teach me new things such as traditions and dances. Being part of New Maroon camp would give me the opportunity to connect with other students that have the same common goal of helping incoming bulldogs have a comfortable transition to Mississippi State.","An important quality of a leader is being motivating.

New Maroon camp was a way for me to meet new people. I now have multiple faces I can smile an wave at, get lunch with, or have a study session with. It helped me open up. I was far more social after New Maroon camp than before, and that has helped me tremendously on campus! I want to give that experience to more incoming freshman and be a friendly face to whoever may need it.","Every position for new maroon camp is special. I believe it is important no matter the position, and especially no matter the family group, to uplift everyone and always be positive. I want to have an amazing group of staff and counselors to connect with. As for the campers, I want to offer a safe space and make sure everybody can open up if they'd like to. Daily compliments and conversations go a long way, and I would want nothing more than to offer that to a family I could make.","I personally hope to gain and improve on my leadership qualities. The staff and counselors are free to be themselves and I want to get even more comfortable with showing off my fun side! With how much being a camper helped me, I can only begin to imagine how much being a counselor could as well! My counselors told me how they became super close with their fellow counselors and I want to make those friendly connections.","A leader needs to be kind. In my opinion, it is one of the most important qualities needed. Kindness goes a long way and can make people trust and feel safe around them. With kindness, control and authority are also needed. A leader needs to be able to effectively communicate ideas, events, and plans.

People focus on countless qualities of a leader like being understanding, respectful, optomistic, honest, etc. Which are all important, I also belive that each one that I mentioned is a critical and important quality of a leader.

I gained a great deal of confidence as a camper, and I am eager to help others feel the same way I did. Furthermore, after being on staff during Camp 2025, I thoroughly enjoyed watching all my campers bloom and grow in a way that was very similar to my own experience as a camper.","I plan to support and serve other staff members by remembering how I felt during my first year as a staffer. I remember walking into Taylor Auditorium for meetings with such a large group of people who already knew each other, and I felt like I didn't belong. It wasn't until the staff retreat that I really started meeting people and building connections.

I also hope to grow by gaining more strength to be more vulnerable with other staffers sooner than I have in the past, as I was able to build very close and strong relationships as soon as I did.","I believe an important quality of a leader is the ability to observe and listen. I genuinely believe that you do not have to be the loudest person in the room to be a leader. I think that being able to observe others is a very valuable skill that helps many people who might really need something but don't want to speak up.
